# Neural Network from Scratch for Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a simple feed-forward neural network built from scratch in Python for classification tasks. The neural network is implemented without using high-level deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It is a fundamental learning exercise to understand the internal workings of neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and the optimization process.

## Key Features:
- **Feedforward Neural Network**: Implemented from scratch using Python.
- **Activation Functions**: Supports different activation functions such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh.
- **Backpropagation**: Implements the backpropagation algorithm to update weights and biases.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Supports training the model on datasets, calculating loss, and evaluating accuracy.
- **Data Handling**: The code supports datasets such as **Fashion MNIST** and **make_moons**.

## Installation

To use this code, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required dependencies. You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
